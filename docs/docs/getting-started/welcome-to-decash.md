# Welcome to decash

Right now, moving assets across different blockchain networks is complicated and expensive, much like how the internet was in its early days when sending information was slow and difficult. Users often face high costs, slow transactions, and fragmented liquidity. These issues result in a poor user experience, making it hard for more people to use blockchain technology.

High costs can be a significant problem, making blockchain less practical for everyday use. On top of that, slow processing times can cause frustrating delays, which further reduces the appeal of using blockchain-based applications. Fragmented liquidity, where assets are spread across various isolated rollups, adds another layer of complexity and inefficiency.

For blockchain technology to become more popular and widely used, we need to make it easier and cheaper to transfer assets across different networks. This means creating better ways for different blockchains to work together, lowering transaction fees, and speeding up processing times. Until we solve these problems, it will be hard for blockchain technology to be adopted on a larger scale, as non-frequent blockchain users are unlikely to consider it a viable option.

Innovations like new methods for different blockchains to connect, faster transaction solutions, and more efficient systems show promise in addressing these issues. By making blockchain technology more user-friendly and affordable, these advancements can help it become a key part of our digital world, just like how the internet evolved to be an essential part of our everyday lives.
